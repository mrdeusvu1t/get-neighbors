## Task description ##

> Implement the GetNeighbors method, which returns from a set of *points* only points that are *h*-neighbors for a *point* with integer coordinates *x* and *y*.
>
> The point *neighbor(xNeighbor, yNeighbor)* is *h*-neighbor for the given *point(x, y)* with a range *h* (*h* is an positive integer)
> if the coordinates of these points are such that `|xNeighbor - x|<=h` and `|yNeighbor - n|<=h`.
>
> The points resulting from sorting should not be sorted (in arbitrary order).
